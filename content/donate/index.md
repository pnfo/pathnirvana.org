Since Path Nirvana Foundation (PNF) is a US non profit organization, your donation would be exempt from taxes to the limits allowed by federal tax laws. PNF is run by volunteers and therefore no administrative costs are involved in PNF. Even the wire transfer fees will be born by our volunteers, so that 100% of your donation will reach the cause/project you are supporting.

You can initiate a Zelle transfer to our email info@pathnirvana.org from your mobile banking app or bank website to make a donation.

Alternately you may mail us a check at “964 San Simeon Dr, Concord CA 94518” payable to “Path Nirvana Foundation”.

You can donate to us using Paypal. Click the donate button below to make your donation. Paypal charges a small fee from each donation. So we recommend you to try either of the above options if possible.
