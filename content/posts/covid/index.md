Path Nirvana Foundation (USA) and Kalana Mithuro Organization (France) have worked together with Sri Lankan doctors and hospitals to compile a list of essential medical equipment. These items would be used to help vulnerable COVID victims like pregnant mothers. The two foundations have formed a way to purchase and ship this equipment to Sri Lanka. The cost of these items are really high. So we urge all supporters to help us in this cause.
