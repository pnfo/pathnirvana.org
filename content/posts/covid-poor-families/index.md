As a result of the lockdown and curfew imposed by various local governments in South Asia many of the families who had non-regular jobs are out of work unable to buy food and medicine. We are coordinating with various local Sri Lankan organizations in the ground to provide necessary groceries directly to the most needed neighborhoods. Some photos from one of the projects that was recently completed are posted below.

Our organization is run by volunteers and 100% of your tax deductible donation will go to the hands of the poor as food and medicine. We have lot of experience working with Sri Lankan charity groups and as a Buddhist organization with high moral standard we take our responsibly with your donation very seriously.

You can make a tax deductible [donation here via Paypal or send us a check](/donate).
