Hospital Service Support Foundation is established with the aim of providing the Opportunity to aid the growing health-care needs of Sri Lanka. Our primary aim is to create a sustainable platform to connect both the US living Sri Lankan community and other local organizations interested in supporting the welfare needs of developing countries. The partnership with Hospital Services Council (HSC), an existing non-profit organization in Sri Lanka, paves the necessary path to distribute services collected here in the US and successfully distribute them to the needed patients in local hospitals in Sri Lanka. We further ensure our generous donors that all items donated are distributed carefully to selected poverty-stricken patients through an extensive screening process conducted by HSC in coordination with local hospitals to ensure that your donation reaches the best need as possible.
