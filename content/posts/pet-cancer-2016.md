Maharagama Cancer Hospital  in Sri Lanka is badly in need of a PET CT scanner. So far only one private hospital has the facilities necessary to do PET scans. One scan costs around Rs.150,000 and during the course of treatment most patients need to undergo many scans but they cannot  afford private scans.

A PET CT scanner costs approximately Rs. 200 million.  The lack of a PET CT scanner has caused complications and irregularities in the diagnosis of cancer. In other words, a PET scan would give hope of life to a person who would have otherwise succumbed to a deadly disease.
