**Project for Providing three months of Amisha Dana for 37 monastics at the Anthar Sumbuddha Pirivena-Kalpitiya during Covid-19.**

As a result of the lockdown and curfew imposed by the government of Sri Lanka, many of the families in this non-Buddhist community in Kalpitiya area are facing many difficulties in providing basic needs to the families. All of the monastic temples also in this area are facing much difficulties receiving basic dana meals now. We have been reached by the Sumitta Nayaka Thero at the Pirivena and expressed there is a huge immediate need for daily amisha dana for 37 monastics at the Pirivena.

During this pandemic, Path Nirvana Foundation has been coordinating with various local Sri Lankan organizations in the ground to provide necessary groceries directly to the most needed neighborhoods and also for monastics Temples/Aranyas facing difficulties. Kalpitiya is a beach side area with mostly non-Buddhist communities. Path Nirvana Foundation has initiated this project to provide amisha dana for the 37 monastics for next three months during the Covid-19 pendenmic.

The cost estimated is $80.00 per day for breakfast and lunch both dana offerings. If you wish to participate in this project, you can make a tax deductible donation [here via Paypal or send us a check](/donate).
